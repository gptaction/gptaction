**Introduction:**
- Briefly introduce the importance of data integrity and cleanliness in databases.
- Mention that identifying and handling duplicate records is a common and crucial task in database management.

**Method 1: Using GROUP BY and HAVING Clauses**
- Explain the use of the `GROUP BY` clause to aggregate data by specific columns.
- Introduce the `HAVING` clause to filter the results to show only those with a count higher than 1.
- Provide an example SQL query:
  ```sql
  SELECT column_name, COUNT(*)
  FROM table_name
  GROUP BY column_name
  HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
  ```

**Method 2: Self-Join Technique**
- Describe the concept of a self-join and how it can be used to find duplicates.
- Show an example where a table is joined to itself to compare rows and find duplicates.
- Example SQL query:
  ```sql
  SELECT a.*
  FROM table_name a
  JOIN table_name b ON a.column_name = b.column_name
  WHERE a.row_id < b.row_id;
  ```

**Method 3: Using Window Functions**
- Introduce window functions like `ROW_NUMBER()`.
- Explain how partitioning data with `OVER` can be used to find duplicates.
- Example SQL query:
  ```sql
  SELECT column_name, ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY column_name ORDER BY another_column) as rn
  FROM table_name
  HAVING rn > 1;
  ```

**Conclusion:**
- Summarize the importance of choosing the right method based on specific database and data requirements.
- Encourage readers to experiment with these methods in their environments.

**Call to Action:**
- Invite readers to share their experiences or ask questions in the comments.
