**Introduction**

Embarking on the journey of learning Node.js can be an exhilarating experience for beginners eager to delve into the world of backend development. Node.js, a runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a web browser, has revolutionized how developers build efficient and scalable web applications. This guide aims to lay a solid foundation for those new to Node.js, guiding you through the creation of your first Node.js application. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a basic understanding of Node.js and how to utilize it to build a simple, yet functional web application.

**Getting Started with Node.js**

Before diving into the practical aspects, it's essential to understand what Node.js is and why it's a preferred choice for many developers. Node.js enables JavaScript to be used for server-side scripting, running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. This means you can use JavaScript to handle HTTP requests, interact with databases, and manage file systems, making it a powerful tool for developing web applications.

**Step 1: Setting Up Your Environment**

The first step in your Node.js journey is to set up your development environment. This involves installing Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager), which comes bundled with Node.js. npm is an essential tool for managing packages and dependencies in your Node.js projects.

1. Download and install Node.js from the official website nodejs.org.
2. After installation, open your terminal or command prompt and type `node -v` and `npm -v` to verify that Node.js and npm are successfully installed.

**Step 2: Creating Your First Node.js Application**

Now that you have your environment set up, it's time to create your first Node.js application. For this tutorial, we'll build a simple "Hello World" application.

1. Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it.
2. Initialize a new Node.js project by running `npm init` in your terminal. This command creates a `package.json` file in your project directory, which will manage the project's dependencies.
3. Create a new file named `app.js` in your project directory.
4. Open `app.js` in your favorite text editor and write the following code:

```javascript
const http = require('http');

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
  res.statusCode = 200;
  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
  res.end('Hello World\n');
});

const port = 3000;
const hostname = '127.0.0.1';

server.listen(port, hostname, () => {
  console.log(`Server running at http://${hostname}:${port}/`);
});
```

This code creates a simple web server that listens on port 3000 and responds with "Hello World" to any incoming requests.

5. Save the file and run your application by typing `node app.js` in your terminal.
6. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:3000/`. You should see your "Hello World" message displayed.

**Conclusion**

Congratulations! You've just created your first Node.js application. While this is a basic example, it serves as a stepping stone into the vast and dynamic world of Node.js development. As you become more comfortable with Node.js, you can explore more complex topics, such as Express.js for routing, connecting to databases, and building RESTful APIs. The journey of learning Node.js is ongoing and constantly evolving, but with patience and practice, you'll find it to be a rewarding and invaluable skill in your development toolkit.
